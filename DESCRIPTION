Description: Allows the user to estimate transition probabilities for
    migratory animals between any two phases of the annual cycle, using a
    variety of different data types. Also quantifies the strength of
    migratory connectivity (MC), a standardized metric to quantify the
    extent to which populations co-occur between two phases of the annual
    cycle. Includes functions to estimate MC and the more traditional
    metric of migratory connectivity strength (Mantel correlation; rM)
    incorporating uncertainty from multiple sources of sampling error. For
    cross-species comparisons, methods are provided to estimate
    differences in migratory connectivity strength, incorporating
    uncertainty.
