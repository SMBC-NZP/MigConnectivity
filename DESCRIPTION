Description: Calculates and estimates the strength of migratory connectivity
    (MC), a standardized metric to quantify the extent to which populations
    co-occur between two phases of the annual cycle. MC is independent of data
    type and accounts for the relative abundance of populations distributed
    across a seasonal range.  MC is equally applicable between any two phases
    of the annual cycle that are temporally distinct, including migratory
    phases. MC can be defined for entire seasonal ranges or for subsets of
    those ranges, as long as those subsets of ranges can be further divided
    into regional populations. The package includes functions to estimate MC
    and the more traditional metric of migratory connectivity strength (Mantel
    correlation; rM) incorporating uncertainty from multiple sources of
    sampling error. Description of the metric can be found in Cohen et al.
    (in press).
