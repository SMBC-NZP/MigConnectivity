Description: Allows the user to estimate transition probabilities for migratory 
    animals between any two phases of the annual cycle, using a variety of 
    different data types. Also quantifies the strength of migratory connectivity 
    (MC), a standardized metric to quantify the extent to which populations 
    co-occur between two phases of the annual cycle. Includes functions to 
    estimate MC and the more traditional metric of migratory connectivity 
    strength (Mantel correlation; rM) incorporating uncertainty from multiple 
    sources of sampling error. For cross-species comparisons, methods are 
    provided to estimate differences in migratory connectivity strength, 
    incorporating uncertainty.
