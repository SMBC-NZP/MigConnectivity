Description: Allows the user to estimate transition probabilities for migratory 
    animals between any two phases of the annual cycle, using a variety of 
    different data types. Also calculates or estimates the strength of migratory
    connectivity (MC), a standardized metric to quantify the extent to which 
    populations co-occur between two phases of the annual cycle. MC is 
    independent of data type and accounts for the relative abundance of 
    populations distributed across a seasonal range.  MC is applicable between 
    any two phases of the annual cycle that are temporally distinct, including 
    migratory phases. MC can be defined for entire seasonal ranges or for 
    subsets of those ranges, as long as those subsets of ranges can be further 
    divided into regional populations. The package includes functions to 
    estimate MC and the more traditional metric of migratory connectivity 
    strength (Mantel correlation; rM) incorporating uncertainty from multiple 
    sources of sampling error. Description of the MC metric can be found in Cohen 
    et al. (2018).
