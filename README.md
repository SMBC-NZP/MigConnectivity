# MigConnectivity [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1002228.svg)](https://zenodo.org/record/1002228#.Wm_Oh3xG1EY)    
The MigConnectivity package quantifies the pattern and strength of migratory connectivity for migratory animals

The pattern of migratory connectivity can be expressed as migratory transition probabilities between sites or regions in any two phases of the annual cycle.

MC is a standardized metric to quantify migratory connectivity strength between two phases of the annual cycle. MC is independent of data type and accounts for the relative abundance of populations distributed across a seasonal range. 

See the [vignettes](https://smbc-nzp.github.io/MigConnectivity/MigConnectivity.html) for details and examples.

## Installation

If you will (or might) use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation in 
MigConnectivity, you should first install the program JAGS on your computer, 
available at https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net. Then, now that MigConnectivity 
is on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("MigConnectivity")
```
