# MigConnectivity
The MigConnectivity package estimates the strength of migratory connectivity for migratory animals

Migratory Connectivity (MC) is a standardized metric to quantify migratory connectivity between two phases 
of the annual cycle. MC is independent of data type and accounts for the relative abundance of 
populations distributed across a seasonal range. See the [Vignette](https://github.com/SMBC-NZP/MigConnectivity/tree/master/vignettes)  for details and examples.

## Installation

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SMBC-NZP/MigConnectivity")
```

to install the vignette on your machine along with the package use the following code.   
*Note* it takes quite a bit longer to download the package if `build_vignettes = TRUE`

```r
devtools::install_github("SMBC-NZP/MigConnectivity", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
