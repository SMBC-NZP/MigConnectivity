# MigConnectivity
The MigConnectivity package estimates the Strength of Migratory Connectivity for Migratory Animals

Migratory Connectivity (MC) is a standardized metric to quantify migratory connectivity between two phases 
of the annual cycle. MC is independent of data type and accounts for the relative abundance of 
populations distributed across a seasonal range. See the [Vignette](https://github.com/SMBC-NZP/MigConnectivity/blob/master/vignettes/MigConnectivity.pdf')  for details and examples.
